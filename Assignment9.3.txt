1.What is meant by FlumeNG ?
FlumeNG is the latest major revision of Apache Flume.
Flume is used for high volume of data ingestion into the hdfs of event based data.
FlumeNG uses a single-hop message delivery guarantee semantics to provide end-to-end reliability 
for the system.
To ensure this feature, certain new concepts have been introduced into its design,
while some of the existing concepts have been either redefined, reused or dropped.



2.Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow?
Yes, Flume can provide 100% reliability to the data flow.
As it follows a transactional based approach and it uses a seperate transactions for guarantee delivery 
between source to channel and the channel to sink.


3.Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations?
Yes , Flume can distribute data to multiple destinations by the process of fan out where
data flow from single source to multiple channels and from the channels to multiple sink.

ex:                   channel1 = sink1
          source  =
                      channel2 = sink2


4.Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is
faster?
Fulme comes with 2 types of channel
Memory Channel : Data are read from source to memory and transferred to the sink.
File Channel   : The file channel transfers the contents from the source to a file in the file system and 
deletes the file after the contents have been succesfully delivered to the sink.
Memory channel is the fastest among the two.
